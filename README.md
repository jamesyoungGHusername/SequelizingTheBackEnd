  # Installation

  # Usage 

The app displays a main menu, and allows the user to select from several options that allow to view or add to sections of the database. They can save or view employees, roles, and departments. Many of the prompt functions take exit points as params, allowing the user to, for example, create a new role midway through creating a new employee, and when they're done they'll be returned to right where they left off while creating the employee without losing any progress.
